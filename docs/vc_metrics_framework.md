# VC Metrics Framework: Real Traction vs. Hype

This document defines 5 critical on-chain metrics used to evaluate the long-term viability of GameFi/SocialFi protocols, focusing on filtering out inorganic activity.

## 1. Stickiness Ratio (DAU/MAU)
*   **Definition:** The ratio of Daily Active Users (DAU) to Monthly Active Users (MAU).
*   **Why it Matters:** Indicates how "habit-forming" the protocol is. A ratio > 0.2 (20%) typically implies users engage daily (like a social network), whereas < 0.05 suggests transient usage.
*   **VC Lens:** High Stickiness > 0.15 validates "product-market fit" beyond token farming.

## 2. Adjusted Day-7 Retention (Bot-Filtered)
*   **Definition:** Percentage of users from a specific cohort who are active again on Day 7, excluding users with < 5 transactions or < $10 lifetime volume.
*   **Why it Matters:** Standard retention is easily gamed by bots. Adjusted retention reveals *high-quality* user loyalty.
*   **VC Lens:** Day-7 Retention > 10% for consumer crypto apps is a strong signal of organic interest.

## 3. Token Velocity
*   **Definition:** `Daily Transaction Volume (in Tokens) / Circulating Supply`.
*   **Why it Matters:** Measures how frequently the token changes hands. Extradinarily high velocity often signals speculative mania or "dumping" rather than utility holding.
*   **VC Lens:** We look for *stabilizing* velocity as the user base grows. Increasing velocity with decreasing retention is a red flag (exit liquidity behavior).

## 4. Value Capture Per User (ARP-DAU)
*   **Definition:** `Total Protocol Revenue / Daily Active Users`.
*   **Why it Matters:** Measures the economic efficiency of the user base. In GameFi, this could be marketplace fees + sink events.
*   **VC Lens:** Rising ARP-DAU proves the protocol can monetize its traction, differentiating it from "growth-at-all-costs" Ponzi models.

## 5. The "Real User" Ratio
*   **Definition:** `Percentage of DAU interacting with non-token contracts` (e.g., actually playing the game logic vs. just swapping dates).
*   **Why it Matters:** Separates speculators/farmers from product users.
*   **VC Lens:** A healthy protocol should have >60% of txns interacting with core game/social contracts, not just the DEX/Staking contract.
