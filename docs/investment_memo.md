# Investment Committee Memo: "Project X" Analysis

**Date:** 2024-05-21
**Analyst:** [Your Name]
**Recommendation:** **PASS** (Watchlist for Q3)

## Executive Summary
While "Project X" has demonstrated significant hype-driven volume ($50M+ cumulative), our on-chain analysis reveals a concerning disconnect between **token velocity** and **organic retention**. Despite a 400% surge in token price over the last quarter, the *Stickiness Ratio* remains below 0.08, indicating transient, mercenary capital rather than genuine product-market fit.

## Key Findings

1.  **Retention Reality Check**:
    *   reported "100k Users" acts as a vanity metric.
    *   **Adjusted Day-7 Retention** (filtering bots) is only **4.2%**, significantly below the GameFi benchmark of 15-20%. This suggests users are extracting value (farming) and leaving, rather than reinvesting time or capital.

2.  **Mercenary Behavior**:
    *   **Token Velocity** has spiked to 0.85 daily turnover during price pumps, while DAU growth has plateaued.
    *   Correlation between Price and DAU has decoupled in the last 30 days (Price ⬆️, DAU ➡), a classic signal of a "Speculative Bubble" phase.

3.  **Bot Activity**:
    *   Over 35% of daily transactions originate from addresses with < $1 lifetime balance post-gas, highly indicative of sybil farming for airdrops using automated scripts.

## Conclusion
The project is currently surviving on aggressive token incentives. Once these incentives dry up, the low stickiness suggests a potential "death spiral." We recommend holding off on investment until the team proves they can sustain DAU > 5k without inflationary token rewards.
